This project is designed for pizza lovers who want to order pizza from wherenever they are. PizzaLav contains 4 pages, in PIZZA section that displays the products, you can add products in the favorites section or in the cart section, but also delete them. For implement this functionality I used State Management (useContext, useReducer). Each type of Pizza has an individual page that displays details and images about the respective pizza, in this case I used the useParams hook because the product id is a dynamic parameter. Also to add an alert when adding a product to your cart or favorites, I used useState. 

My project PizzaLav realized in React -> https://pizzalav-react.netlify.app/
